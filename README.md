Struggling to find community for early-career AI researchers in Sydney, we built one. 

Now we're a thriving community with talent in CS, AI, neuroscience, physics, economics, applied mathematics, and chemistry, across 6+ Australian universities.

We hold two paper discussion groups weekly, covering frontier research and mathematics. We share ideas, develop hypotheses, plan experiments, and drive each other forward. 

Whether you're developing models, optimising framework backends, or writing theory - if you want to work at the frontier of AI, this is the community you've been looking for.
